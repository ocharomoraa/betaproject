      Crop loans are a type of short-term advance offered pre-dominantly by primary co-operative societies within the area, to cover the cost of cultivation. It can be used for purchase of quality seeds, fertilizers, manure, etc. This loan can be repaid once the crops have been harvested.

The loan amount is fixed based on the cultivation area and the type of crop being cultivated. The District Technical Committee (DTC) fixes the scale of financing required for each crop in that particular area. The loan amount would be based on that report.
